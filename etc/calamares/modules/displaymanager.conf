# Configure one or more display managers (e.g. SDDM)
# with a "best effort" approach.

# This module also sets up autologin, if the feature is enabled in

# The DM module attempts to set up all the DMs found in this list, in the
# precise order listed. The displaymanagers list can also be set in
# globalstorage, and in that case it overrides the setting here.
#
# If *sysconfigSetup* is set to *true* (see below, only relevant for
# openSUSE derivatives) then this list is ignored and only sysconfig
# is attempted. You can also list "sysconfig" in this list instead.
#
displaymanagers:
  #- slim
  #- sddm
  - lightdm
  #- gdm
  #- mdm
  #- lxdm
  #- greetd

# Enable the following settings to force a desktop environment
# in your displaymanager configuration file. This will attempt
# to configure the given DE (without checking if it is installed).
# The DM configuration for each potential DM may **or may not**
# support configuring a default DE, so the keys are mandatory
# but their interpretation is up to the DM configuration.
#
# Subkeys of *defaultDesktopEnvironment* are (all mandatory):
#  - *executable* a full path to an executable
#  - *desktopFile* a .desktop filename
#
# If this is **not** set, then Calamares will look for installed
# DE's and pick the first one it finds that is actually installed.
#
# If this **is** set, and the *executable* key doesn't point to
# an installed file, then the .desktop file's TryExec key is
# used instead.
